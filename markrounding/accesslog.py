"""Mask secrets in uvicorn's access log.

From the platform template: bibliotekarien-platform/edge/templates/accesslog.py
(see LOGGNING.md there). Only _PATTERNS is app-specific.

The committee's secret report token is in the path (/report/<token>,
/api/report/<token>/…) and gives write access to the regatta. uvicorn logs
every request's full path to stdout, which Alloy ships to Loki — so the access
log stays on (it is needed for incidents), but the token is replaced before the
line is formatted.
